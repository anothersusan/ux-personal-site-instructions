# Personal Bio Site 9: Add SASS to your Personal Bio

### You will be working off of your previous iteration of your Personal Bio site.

## Requirements

1.  Add SASS to your project for all styling.  You will need to change your Gruntfile and add an NPM package.

2.  None of the following should exist in your project:
* Hex colors (except in variable definitions)
* Lots of repetative CSS - if classes share the same properties you should define that in one place and extend where needed
* defining the class each time for different pseudoclasses ex.  having a .card and a .card:hover - use sass nesting

3. You should make use of SASS things like:
* Variables for colors
* Extend common style 
* Nest your classes
